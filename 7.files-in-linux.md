## “Everything is a file”

One of Linux’s core design philosophies is that “everything is a file” — hardware devices, inter-process communication endpoints, directories, regular data files, sockets, etc., are all treated uniformly in many respects (e.g. they can be referenced via file descriptors).
## Types of files in Linux

In Linux (and Unix-like systems), there are several special file types beyond regular data files. You can see file types when doing `ls -l`: the first character in the mode string indicates the type. [LinuxConfig+1](https://linuxconfig.org/identifying-file-types-in-linux?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Here’s a summary:

| File Type         | Symbol in `ls -l` | Description                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Regular file      | `-`               | Normal files (text, binaries, data)                                            |
| Directory         | `d`               | A folder containing files/directories                                          |
| Symbolic link     | `l`               | A “shortcut” or reference to another file                                      |
| Block device      | `b`               | Devices that transfer data in blocks, e.g. disk partitions                     |
| Character device  | `c`               | Devices that transfer data character by character, e.g. terminal, serial ports |
| Socket            | `s`               | IPC (inter-process communication) endpoint                                     |
| FIFO / Named pipe | `p`               | A pipe that allows processes to communicate via a named conduit                |

For example, `ls -l /dev/null` might show `crw-rw-rw-` (c = character device) etc.

## Linux Filesystems & how files are stored
###  Filesystem hierarchy and mounting

- Linux does **not** use drive letters (like C:, D:\ in Windows). Instead, all files and directories exist under a single root `/` directory. Other partitions, drives, USBs, etc. are _mounted_ into this tree at specific mount points (like `/mnt/usb`, `/home`, `/var`, etc.). [Opensource.com+1](https://opensource.com/life/16/10/introduction-linux-filesystems?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- The layout and structure of standard directories (like `/etc`, `/usr`, `/home`, etc.) are governed by the **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)**.

### Supported Filesystem types

Linux supports many different filesystem types; each has strengths and trade-offs.
Here are some of the commonly used ones:

| Filesystem                                        | Key Features / Use Cases                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ext4**                                          | Most common default. Journaling, good performance, stable.                                                       |
| **XFS**                                           | Scalable, good for large files and high performance environments.                                                |
| **Btrfs**                                         | Modern features: snapshots, built-in volume management, checksums, etc.                                          |
| **ZFS**                                           | Advanced features like integrity checking, snapshots, pooling (often used in enterprise setups)                  |
| **ReiserFS, JFS**                                 | Older journaling file systems; still supported but less common in new installations                              |
| **read-only / compressed FS** (e.g. **SquashFS**) | Useful for live CDs, embedded systems, read-only media.                                                          |
| **OverlayFS / union filesystems**                 | Combines multiple filesystems (e.g. read-only + read-write) into one view. Common in container / live-CD setups. |

Also, Linux supports mounting other OS filesystems (e.g. **NTFS**, **exFAT**, **FAT32**) for compatibility, though they may lack full support for Unix permissions, journaling, etc.


## Key concepts & metadata

- **Inode**: Each file/directory is represented internally by an inode, which stores metadata (owner, permissions, timestamps, pointers to data blocks) but not the filename itself.
- **Permissions & ownership**: Each file has read (r), write (w), execute (x) permissions for owner, group, and others, plus ownership by a user and group.
- **Journaling**: Many modern filesystems (like ext4, XFS) maintain a journal (a log of changes) to reduce risk of corruption during crashes or power loss.
- **Mount / Unmount**: To use a partition or device, it must be mounted to a directory. To remove it safely, you unmount (`umount`).
