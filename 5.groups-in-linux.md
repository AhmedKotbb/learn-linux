## **What Is a Group in Linux?**

In Linux, a **group** is a collection of users.  
Groups are used to **simplify permission management** — instead of giving file or directory access to each user individually, you assign permissions to a group, and all its members inherit those rights.
In short:
> A _group_ is a way to manage a set of users collectively.

## **Types of Groups**
There are two main kinds of groups in Linux:

| **Group Type**                       | **Description**                                                                                                  | **Example**                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary Group**                    | Each user has exactly one **primary group**. Files created by the user are automatically assigned to this group. | User `ahmed` might have a primary group also called `ahmed`. |
| **Secondary (Supplementary) Groups** | A user can belong to **multiple other groups** for shared access to resources.                                   | `ahmed` could also be in `sudo`, `developers`, `docker`.     |
You can check a user’s group membership with:
`groups ahmed`
or 
`id ahmed` 

When you create a new user (e.g., `ahmed`), Linux automatically creates a **primary group** with the same name by default — this is called the **User Private Group (UPG)** scheme (used by Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.).

## **Group IDs (GID)**
Just like users have UIDs, groups have **GIDs (Group IDs)**.
Typical ranges:

|**Group Type**|**GID Range**|
|---|---|
|System Groups|0–999|
|Regular Groups|1000+|
you can check all groups  with:
`cat /etc/group`

## **Configuration Files Involved**

| **File**       | **Purpose**                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/etc/group`   | Stores group information (`group_name:x:GID:user_list`) |
| `/etc/gshadow` | Stores encrypted group passwords and admin info         |
