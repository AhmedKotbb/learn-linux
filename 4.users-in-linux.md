In Linux, users are categorized based on their roles and privileges. The operating system uses this structure to manage permissions, security, and access control. Here are the **main types of users in Linux**

### **1. Root User (Superuser)**

- **Description:**  
    The root user is the **most powerful account** on a Linux system. It has unrestricted access to all commands, files, directories, and system resources.
- **Privileges:**
    - Can create, modify, and delete any file or user.
    - Can install or remove software.
    - Can change system configurations.
- **Command-line identifier:** The shell prompt usually ends with `#` for the root user.
- **Example username:** `root`

### **2. Regular (Normal) Users**

- **Description:**  
    These are standard user accounts created for individual people or applications. They have limited privileges, typically restricted to their own home directory.
- **Privileges:**
    - Can create, modify, or delete files within their own directory.
    - Cannot perform administrative tasks without `sudo`.
- **Command-line identifier:** The shell prompt usually ends with `$` for normal users.

### **3. System Users (Service Accounts)**

- **Description:**  
    These are non-login accounts created by the system or during software installation to run background services (daemons) securely without granting them full privileges.
- **Examples:**  
    `daemon`, `bin`, `sys`, `www-data`, `mysql`, `sshd`
- **Purpose:**  
    Each service runs under its own account to minimize security risks in case of a compromise.


Note: is the  `passwd` file you will see all the available users on your linux machine `cat /etc/passwd`
you will find the three types of users we mentioned each user have his ID 
- root user have ID 0
- system users have IDs from 1-999 
- normal users have IDs from 1000+
